# Linguistic Alignment in Collborative Coding Tasks -- A comparison between groups of middle school and undergraduate students
This is the group project for the LIN6932 Computational Linguistics at University of Florida. 

Group member: Amanda Griffith, Zane Price, Xiaoyi Tian 

## Files

**Poster presentation**: linguistic-alignment project-poster.pdf

**calculating local syntactic alignment**: Local_1_syntactic_alignment.ipynb -> used for RQ3 in the linguistic alignmnet journal paper

**calculating local lexical alignment**: Local_2_lexical_alignment.ipynb -> used for RQ3 in the linguistic alignmnet journal paper

**calculating global lexical alignment**: Lexical_Alignment_ms.ipynb


## The follow-up analysis of this project has produced a journal paper
Preprint of the paper and Analysis code for RQ1 and RQ2 is available through this link: https://osf.io/97sak/

Code for RQ3 are the two local alignment files in this repo: `Local_1_syntactic_alignment.ipynb` and `Local_2_lexical_alignment.ipynb`
